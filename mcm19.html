													<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
													<p>In the fictional television series Game of Thrones, based on the series of epic fantasy novels A Song of Ice and Fire, three dragons are raised by Daenerys Targaryen, the “Mother of Dragons.” When hatched, the dragons are small, roughly 10 kg, and after a year grow to roughly 30-40 kg. They continue to grow throughout their life depending on the conditions and amount of food available to them.</p>

													<p>For the purposes of this problem, consider these three fictional dragons are living today. Assume that the basic biology of dragons described above is accurate. You will need to make some additional assumptions about dragons that might include, for example, that dragons are able to fly great distances, breath fire, and resist tremendous trauma. As you address the problem requirements, it should be clear how your assumptions are related to the physical constraints of the functions, size, diet, changes, or other characteristics associated with the animals.
													Your team is assigned to analyze dragon characteristics, behavior, habits, diet, and interaction with their environment. To do so, you will have to consider many questions. At a minimum, address the following: What is the ecological impact and requirements of the dragons? What are the energy expenditures of the dragons, and what are their caloric intake requirements? How much area is required to support the three dragons? How large a community is necessary to support a dragon for varying levels of assistance that can be provided to the dragons? Be clear about what factors you are considering when addressing these questions.</p>

													<p>As with other animals that migrate, dragons might travel to different regions of the world with very different climates. How important are the climate conditions to your analysis? For example, would moving a dragon between an arid region, a warm temperate region, and an arctic region make a big difference in the resources required to maintain and grow a dragon?</p>

													<h3>Notes</h3>
													<p>Looking back trying to analyze how and why we won this competition, a few things came to mind. Firstly, we were incredibly privileged to all have 4 full days to completely devote to it without having to worry about school or work. This is an international competition, and it happened to happen during our winter break and we were able to clear our work schedules for those four days. Obviously, not everyone is privileged enough to do this. Secondly, all members of the team were big game of thrones fans (this was before the final season aired and before it became clear that the book series would never be completed). Thirdly, and most serendipitously, I and another team member had just finished reading <i>Scale</i> by Geoffery West; a book that was, in part, about how metabolic rates scale in differently sized animals. It's not often the benefits of reading reward you so immediately and concretely! With the book fresh in our minds, we were able to hit the ground running and start off with a nuanced and informed estimate of the metabolic rates of the dragons. Winning this competition gave me the push to continue my math education at Johns Hopkins, so reading that book was one of those little choices that ended up having a huge impact on my life! Anyway, our paper is included below:</p>
